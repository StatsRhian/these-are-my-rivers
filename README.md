# These are my rivers [![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

I like kayaking. Generally I prefer sea kayaking, but I'm enjoying exploring the rivers of the North West with the Lancaster Canoe Club. 

The thing I'm really enjoying about exploring rivers is rediscovering my local area which I thought I knew well. I've cycled all up and down the Lune valley, but I couldn't draw out the route of the River Lune on a map. 

I've downloaded the OS data for all the water links in the U.K. My plan is to create a high quality, hopefully beautiful map of the rivers I love in the North West. 

This project which involve choosing the rivers I want to display and designing a minimal but detailed artistic poster. 

I'm hoping for a mashup between StravaArt and Tufte design.
